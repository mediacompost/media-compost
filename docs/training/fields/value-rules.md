## Value rules

### Value rules

Any tag shaped `<name>:<number><unit>` is a value tag — `people:3`, `height:172cm`, `height:1.72m`, or a ranking’s own `quality:7` — and a rule here turns a range of those numbers into words at prompt time: where `height` is greater than 190cm, write `tall`. A raw `height:172cm` token teaches a text encoder nothing it can read back at generation time; a word does.

A matching tag is replaced by the rule’s text, and a per-rule toggle keeps the raw tag alongside for whoever wants both spellings in the prompt. The metric length and mass families convert, so one rule covers `172cm` and `1.72m` alike; an unknown unit compares only against the same unit, and a plain number only against plain numbers.

Ranges may overlap, and the first matching rule wins — the rows are dragged into order, and that order is part of the configuration. A value tag no rule matches passes through the prompt unchanged, so nothing is dropped silently. The rule’s phrase rides the ordinary random pick and dropout like the tag it replaced: prompts sometimes carry it and sometimes do not, which is exactly the variation score-tag conditioning wants.

The rules are resolved when the dataset is built — the job’s log says how many tags they matched — and a set of rules can be saved and loaded by name, so a house vocabulary is written once and reused across jobs. Loading a set adds its missing rules to the job rather than replacing the rows already there.
